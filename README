siple: a Small Inverse Problems Library


*************************************************************************
Overview:

The siple library is a collection of python based tools for solving
certain kinds of inverse problems.


*************************************************************************
Installation:

A basic installation can be done using

python setup.py install

This will install siple at the system-wide level; you might need to run this command with 'sudo' to have the necessary privileges.  You
can install it just for your user account using

python setup.py install --user

For other options, use 

python setup.py install --help

See also the comments at the start of setup.py


*************************************************************************
Documentation:

The documentation is built using sphinx and pdfLaTeX, which must
be installed.  In particular, see sphinx.pocoo.org.

To build the HTML API reference:

cd docs
make html

The documentation can then be accessed via

docs/build/html/index.html

There is also a tutorial (in progress):

cd docs
make tutorial

which will generate docs/siple_tutorial.pdf


*************************************************************************
Examples:

The scripts in the examples directory use siple to solve inverse problems 
described in the tutorial.  See the comments at the beginning of each example to see a brief description of what is being done, and run the example with, e.g., 

python examples/derivative.py
