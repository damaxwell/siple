Tutorial
========================

This tutorial covers solving two example inverse problems, one linear 
problem and one nonlinear problem.  These problems correspond
to examples 1 and 2 in the |siple| :file:`examples` directory.

A certain amount of familiarity
with inverse problems is required to fully follow the examples.
The reader might want to consult the :ref:`crashcourse`, which also
establishes some of the notation used in the tutorial.
