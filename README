can install it just for your user account using

python setup.py install --user

For other options, use 

python setup.py install --help

or 

python setup.py --help

Documentation:

There is a tutorial (in progress) in the docs directory.

API documentation using sphinx will be forthcoming.



*************************************************************************

The scripts in the examples directory use siple to solve inverse problems 
described in the tutorial.  See the comments at the beginning of each example to see a brief description of what is being done, and run the example with, e.g., 

python examples/derivative.py
